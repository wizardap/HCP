# SAT-based-CEGAR / HCP Solver

> **Original Work & Attribution:** This repository is based on and extends the Hamiltonian Cycle Problem (HCP) SAT-based CEGAR solver developed by **Takehide Soh** (Kobe University, Japan) at [`https://github.com/TakehideSoh/SAT-based-CEGAR`](https://github.com/TakehideSoh/SAT-based-CEGAR).

## 1. Overview & Components

- **`src/cegar-fix`**: Native Rust-based Hamiltonian Cycle Solver utilizing in-Rust CNF encoding, incremental CaDiCaL SAT solving (via `rustsat`), multi-level 2-opt/3-opt cycle patching, MTZ stall injection, and degree-2 contraction.
- **`docs/`**: Comprehensive technical architecture documentation, benchmark analyses, and experimental reports:
  - [`docs/rust_solver_architecture_and_methods.md`](docs/rust_solver_architecture_and_methods.md): Full technical breakdown of all algorithms and CLI flags in the Rust codebase (`cegar-fix`).
  - [`docs/graph950_methods_and_experiments_report.md`](docs/graph950_methods_and_experiments_report.md): Deep-dive research report on methods attempted on `graph950.col`.
  - [`docs/timeout-classification-analysis.md`](docs/timeout-classification-analysis.md): Systematic categorization of timeout dynamics across 1,001 FHCP benchmark instances.
- **`logs/`**: Consolidated experimental logs, runtime data CSVs, and sample JSONs across the 1,001 FHCPCS benchmark graphs.
- **`scratch/`**: Prototyping scripts, two-tier decomposition experiments, and verification tools.

## 2. Solvers & Libraries

- **CaDiCaL** (<https://github.com/arminbiere/cadical> version 1.9.4 / 1.9.5)
- **rustsat** (<https://github.com/chrjabs/rustsat> version 0.6.1)
- **PySAT** (`pysat.solvers.Cadical195`) for Python-based decomposition prototypes.
